# Hi there, I'm Rita 👋


I'm a **frontend developer** with a passion for building intuitive and accessible web interfaces — but my love for **Node.js** and backend runs deep too.

💻 **Currently learning:** I'm expanding my skills through the [RS School/ Node.js course](https://rs.school/courses/nodejs), diving deeper into full-stack development.

🌱 **Side project:**
I developed [exb-nsk.ru](https://exb-nsk.ru/), a website for a local church community. From figma to deploy.

🛠️ **Tech I enjoy working with:**
- Frontend: React, Next.js, Tailwind, Figma
- Backend: Node.js, Express, Strapi, PostgreSQL
- DevOps: Docker, Caddy, Coolify

🔍 I'm looking for opportunities to grow as a **full-stack developer**, especially in projects where I can combine UX thinking with scalable backend.
